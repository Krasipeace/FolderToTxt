## How to Use

Download the .zip from [Releases](https://github.com/Krasipeace/FolderToTxt/releases)

1. Place the executable (`FolderToTxt.exe`) inside any folder you want to scan.
2. Run the exe.
3. The app will prompt you to choose whether to include hidden files/folders.
4. You can enter a file extension filter to list only files of that type, or leave blank to list all files.
5. The app generates a `folder-contents.txt` file in the same directory with the formatted listing.

## Requirements

- .NET 8 or later runtime installed (if running the published framework-dependent version).
- Alternatively, use the self-contained published executable to run on any Windows PC(x64) without requiring .NET installation from [Releases](https://github.com/Krasipeace/FolderToTxt/releases).
